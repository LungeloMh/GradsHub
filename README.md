# Career Plug

## Goal:
**Career Plug** is a simplified platform made to make it easier to place, hire, and train graduates. By facilitating profile management, job matching, document verification, and ranking, it links graduates with Small, Medium, and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) and other organizations. By giving graduates the necessary resources to properly showcase their abilities and helping businesses choose the best candidates, this software closes the knowledge gap between academics and business.
